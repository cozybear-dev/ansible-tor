sysctl_hardening:
      ## Kernel self-protection ##

      ## A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory.
      ## These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel, but kernel pointers are
      ## not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example, reading
      ## the contents of /proc/kallsyms. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer
      ## leaks. Alternatively, you can set kernel.kptr_restrict=1 to only hide kernel
      ## pointers from processes without the CAP_SYSLOG capability.
      kernel.kptr_restrict: 1

      ## dmesg is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel
      ## debugging information, but this can often leak sensitive information, such
      ## as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to
      ## the CAP_SYSLOG capability.
      kernel.dmesg_restrict: 1

      ## eBPF exposes quite large attack surface. As such, it must be restricted.
      ## These sysctls restrict eBPF to the CAP_BPF capability (CAP_SYS_ADMIN on
      ## kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable JIT hardening techniques, such as
      ## constant blinding.
      kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled: 1
      net.core.bpf_jit_harden: 2

      ## This restricts loading TTY line disciplines to the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability
      ## to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines
      ## with the TIOCSETD ioctl which has been abused in a number of exploits before.
      dev.tty.ldisc_autoload: 0

      ## The userfaultfd() syscall is often abused to exploit use-after-free flaws.
      ## Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict this syscall to the
      ## CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability.
      vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd: 0

      ## kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime.
      ## This functionality can be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain
      ## arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
      kernel.kexec_load_disabled: 1

      ## Networking ##

      ## This helps protect against SYN flood attacks which are a form of denial of
      ## service attack, in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN
      ## requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system
      ## unresponsive to legitimate traffic.
      net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies: 1

      ## This protects against time-wait assassination by dropping RST packets for
      ## sockets in the time-wait state.
      net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337: 1

      ## This setting makes your system ignore all ICMP requests to avoid Smurf
      ## attacks, make the device more difficult to enumerate on the network and
      ## prevent clock fingerprinting through ICMP timestamps.
      net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all: 1

      ## Malicious IPv6 router advertisements can result in a man-in-the-middle
      ## attack so they should be disabled.
      net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra: 0

      ## This disables TCP SACK. SACK is commonly exploited and unnecessary for many
      ## circumstances so it should be disabled if you don't require it.
      net.ipv4.tcp_sack: 0
      net.ipv4.tcp_dsack: 0
      net.ipv4.tcp_fack: 0

      ## Userspace ##

      ## ptrace is a system call that allows a program to alter and inspect another
      ## running process which allows attackers to trivially modify the memory of
      ## other running programs. This restricts usage of ptrace to only processes
      ## with the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability. Alternatively, set the sysctl to 3
      ## to disable ptrace entirely.
      kernel.yama.ptrace_scope: 2

      ## This only permits symlinks to be followed when outside of a world-writable
      ## sticky directory, when the owner of the symlink and follower match, or when
      ## the directory owner matches the symlink's owner. This also prevents
      ## hardlinks from being created by users that do not have read/write access
      ## to the source file. Both of these prevent many common TOCTOU races.
      fs.protected_symlinks: 1
      fs.protected_hardlinks: 1

      ## ASLR is a common exploit mitigation which randomises the position of
      ## critical parts of a process in memory. This can make a wide variety of
      ## exploits harder to pull off as they first require an information leak.
      ## The above settings increase the bits of entropy used for mmap ASLR,
      ## improving its effectiveness.
      vm.mmap_rnd_bits: 32
      vm.mmap_rnd_compat_bits: 16
